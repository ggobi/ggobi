</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Q1.&#9;Can I modify the source and distribute it to someone else?</P>
<P>A1.&#9;Yes, but you need to package the modifications separately,
usually as a patch file.</P>
<BR>
<P>Q2.&#9;Can I give the original source capsule to someone else? </P>
<P>A2.&#9;You can, provided that the person you give it to has agreed to
these same conditions.&#9;The person does not have to physically sign the
license, but they must affirmatively agree to the same license agreement
that you have.&#9;We have enclosed this agreement with the package.</P>
<BR>
<P>Q3.&#9;If I make changes to the source, can I keep them private?</P>
<P>A3.&#9;You can as long as you do not distribute them to anyone else.
If you distribute them to anyone else, then you need to make the changes
available to AT&amp;T and give AT&amp;T the right to distribute these changes
without any royalties.</P>
<BR>

<P>Q4.&#9;What types of changes must I make available to AT&amp;T?</P>
<P>A4.&#9;You only need to inform AT&amp;T of changes to the source code files
that are provided by AT&amp;T.</P>
<BR>

<P>Q5.&#9;Can I distribute copies of binaries, compiled from the original
or modified source, within and outside my company or organization? </P>
<P>A5.  Yes.  The binaries should include the notice set forth in the
agreement indicating that some of the underlying source code came
from AT&amp;T.</P>
<BR>

<P>Q6.&#9;Can I sell binaries?</P>
<P>A6.&#9;Yes, provided that you adhere to the terms of the license, for
example in not misrepresenting your relationship with AT&amp;T.
<BR>

<P>Q7.&#9;Are there any patents that would affect the use of this software?</P>
<P>A7.&#9;The agreement allows you to use the AT&amp;T source code (within the
guidelines set forth in the agreement) without worrying about whether
such usage infringes any patents AT&amp;T may have.  AT&amp;T, however, cannot
assure that the software does not infringe some other unknown third
party's patents, which is why AT&amp;T asks that you check the website
<A HREF=http://www.research.att.com/areas/stat/ggobi>
http://www.research.att.com/areas/stat/ggobi </A> for any notices
relating to the software. You may find it helpful to use an automated
service such as <A HREF="http://mindit.netmind.com/">MindIt</A> to
monitor the website.
</P>
<BR>

<P>Q8.&#9;Does AT&amp;T provide support for any of this software?</P>
<P>A8.&#9;AT&amp;T does not provide support for the source code at this time.</P>
<BR>

<P>Q9.&#9;Can I redistribute the source files outside the original capsule,
e.g. in a CD-ROM file system?</P>
<P>A9.&#9;Yes, as long as the exact same set of files is distributed.

<P>Q10.&#9;Can I obtain a different license to cover commercial applications
where I do not want to release patches?</P>
<P>A10.&#9;
Please contact AT&amp;T if you are interested in a license that differs
from the terms in the source code agreement, or if you have any questions
regarding the agreement.</P>
